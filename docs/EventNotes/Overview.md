Google Event Notes are files inside obsidian that are generated by this plugin.
Event notes are supposed to link your obsidian knowledge with you google calendar life.
Event Notes are defined by the `event-id` yaml frontmatter.
Every note containing this special frontmatter key are event notes.


When generating event notes the default name for a new note will be the title of the event itself.
This can be changes in the settings.

You can add the the following placeholders to generate the name more dynamically.


- ``

- `{{event-date}}`
- `{{event-title}}` (default)
- `{{date-day}}`
- `{{date-month}}`
- `{{date-year}}`
- `{{event-day}}`
- `{{event-month}}`
- `{{event-year}}`


To improve performance when searching the vault for event notes a special event note prefix can be specified. The plugin will only check for files starting with the prefix.
